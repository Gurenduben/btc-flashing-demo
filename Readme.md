# Bitcoin Flashing Demo
This repo contains a demo on how bitcoin flashing works. This software is for education only, I assume no responsibility for improper use.  

To make it work you need to modify some methods of [bitcoinlib](https://bitcoinlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as explained in the article describing the experiment: [https://nicods96.github.io/hi/bitcoin-flashing/](https://nicods96.github.io/hi/bitcoin-flashing/)
